# Demos of Dynamically Generated Xcode Projects of Max / MSP Externals

This folder contains some illustrative demonstrations of:

- Using [Xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to generate an xcode project (every time you build) a max or msp external from a yaml spec. Basically, the intent was to separate the build spec from the xcode project.

- Obtaining the path of an external in a cross-platform way (see `simplemax` project)

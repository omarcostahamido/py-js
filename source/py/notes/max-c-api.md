## Sending arbitrary messages to an object

In https://cycling74.com/forums/error-handling-with-object_method_typed, there is a need to figure the type of the method which is being called in sending.


It looks like the `t_messlist` struct in `t_object` is key!

### in `ext_mess.h`:

```c

/** A list of symbols and their corresponding methods,
  complete with typechecking information. 
  @ingroup obj
*/
typedef struct messlist
{
  struct symbol *m_sym;   ///< Name of the message
  method m_fun;       ///< Method associated with the message
  char m_type[MSG_MAXARG + 1];  ///< Argument type information
} t_messlist;
C74_DEPRECATED( typedef struct messlist Messlist );


/** The tiny object structure sits at the head of any object to which you may
  pass messages (and which you may feed to freeobject()).
  In general, you should use #t_object instead.
  @ingroup obj
*/
typedef struct tinyobject
{
  struct messlist *t_messlist;  ///< list of messages and methods 
                  // (also used as freelist link)
#ifdef CAREFUL
  long t_magic;         ///< magic number
#endif
} t_tinyobject;
C74_DEPRECATED( typedef struct tinyobject Tinyobject );


/** The structure for the head of any object which wants to have inlets or outlets,
  or support attributes.
  @ingroup obj
*/
typedef struct object
{
  struct messlist *o_messlist;  ///<  list of messages and methods. The -1 entry of the message list of an object contains a pointer to its #t_class entry.
                  // (also used as freelist link)
#ifdef CAREFUL
  t_ptr_int o_magic;          ///< magic number
#endif
  struct inlet *o_inlet;      ///<  list of inlets
  struct outlet *o_outlet;    ///<  list of outlets
} t_object;
C74_DEPRECATED( typedef struct object Object );

```

Look for functions which return `t_messlist`

### In `ext_obex.h`



Undocumented:

```c
t_messlist *class_mess(t_class *x, t_symbol *methodname);
t_messlist *object_mess(t_object *x, t_symbol *methodname); // <- promising!
t_messlist *class_typedwrapper_get(t_class *x, t_symbol *s);
t_messlist *object_typedwrapper_get(t_object *x, t_symbol *s);
```

There is a `t_method_object` as well:

```c
typedef struct _method_object
{
  t_object  ob;
  t_messlist  messlist_entry;
} t_method_object;
```

Undocumented:
```c
t_method_object *method_object_new(method m, C74_CONST char *name, ...);
t_method_object *method_object_new_messlist(t_messlist *m);
void method_object_free(t_method_object *x);
t_symbol *method_object_getname(t_method_object *x);
void method_object_setname(t_method_object *x, t_symbol *s);
method method_object_getmethod(t_method_object *x);
void method_object_setmethod(t_method_object *x, method m);
t_messlist *method_object_getmesslist(t_method_object *x);
void method_object_setmesslist(t_method_object *x, t_messlist *m);

t_method_object *class_getmethod_object(t_class *x, t_symbol *methodname);

// these methods are private -- instance methods are not actually fully implemented at this time
t_method_object *object_getmethod_object(t_object *x, t_symbol *methodname);
```

see: https://cycling74.com/forums/sending-arbitrary-messages-to-other-objects-from-c

Sending to a coll:

Assuming you already have a valid pointer to a Max object the API  function you use to send a message to a receiving object is:

`object_method()` for methods where Max cannot type check the arguments (`A_CANT`)

or

`object_method_typed()` for methods that take a certain number of arguments of a certain type and therefore have a typed function signature (`A_GIMME`)

If you want to send messages to Max object instantiated in a patch, you probably will want to use `object_method_typed()`.

Be aware that in `ext_obex_util.h` there is a number of convenience functions that allow you to specifically send integer, floats, symbols and more...

For example, if you wanted to send the clear message to a [coll] object, this is the code you would write:

`object_method_typed(collObjPtr, gensym("clear"), 0, NULL, NULL);`

or shorter version: (untyped)

`object_method(collObjPtr, gensym("clear"));`

In this example since the message "clear" has no arguments the typed/untyped distinction doesn't really matter and you could use them interchangeably.




### ext_obex.h

```c
/**
  Sends a type-checked message to an object.

  @ingroup obj

  @param  x   The object that will receive the message 
  @param  s   The message selector
  @param  ac    Count of message arguments in <tt>av</tt>
  @param  av    Array of t_atoms; the message arguments
  @param  rv    Return value of function, if available

  @return     This function returns the error code #MAX_ERR_NONE if successful, 
          or one of the other error codes defined in #e_max_errorcodes if unsuccessful.

  @remark     If the receiver object can respond to the message, object_method_typed() returns the result in <tt>rv</tt>. Otherwise, <tt>rv</tt> will contain an #A_NOTHING atom.
*/
t_max_err object_method_typed(void *x, t_symbol *s, long ac, t_atom *av, t_atom *rv);
```


### ext_obex_util.h

t_max_err object_method_parse(t_object *x, t_symbol *s, C74_CONST char *parsestr, t_atom *rv);
```






## Object Reference


It looks like `obex` is a type `hashtab` (Hash Table), which can be used for storing object references?


## Find named object

see: https://cycling74.com/forums/find-named-object-and-send-it-a-message

  I'm looking at some of the patcher scripting stuff in the api.  iterator.c is a good guide, but I do want to check if there's  a simple method similar to "getnamed" in javascript, such that I don't have to iterate through all the boxes in a patcher.
  Something along the lines of

```c
  t_object *desiredobject = jpatcher_get_namedobject("scriptedname");
```
  and you could then just pass desiredobject into the various jbox goodies.

and the answer

```c
t_max_err err;
t_object *patcher = NULL;
t_object *yourobject = NULL;

// get the patcher
err = object_obex_lookup(yourobjectpointer, gensym("#P"), &patcher);

// get the object that you're looking for.
yourobject = (t_object *)object_method(patcher, gensym("getnamedbox"), gensym("theobjectname"));
```

see: https://cycling74.com/forums/error-handling-with-object_method_typed

Avoiding crashes when sending:

  For messages which are internally defined as A_GIMME the correct call to use is object_method_typed(). But for other messages, say one with A_FLOAT as the argument, you will likely want to use object_method().

Question: 

  "want to send values to a named object, as there is in javascript with 'messnamed'... send values to receive objects."

Answer:

  all send's and receive's with the same name reference a single nobox object called "through", which you can simply retrieving by looking at the s_thing field of the name symbol â€” I mean, if you need to retrieve the through object associated to the "foo" symbol, just look for gensym("foo")->s_thing.
  Once you have the object, just send it a message with object_method().

```c
t_max_err object_send_method_typed(void *x, t_symbol *name, t_symbol *s, long ac, t_atom *av, t_atom *rv)
{
   t_object *thing = name->s_thing;

   if (!thing) {
       return MAX_ERR_INVALID_PTR;
   }
   if (NOGOOD(thing)) {
       return MAX_ERR_INVALID_PTR;
   }
   if (!object_classname_compare(thing, gensym("through"))) {
       return MAX_ERR_GENERIC;
   }
   return object_method_typed(thing, s, ac, av, rv);
}
```



## Storing Refs on a Hashtable

see: https://cycling74.com/forums/help!-crashing-when-scripting-patcher-and-storing-refs-in-a-hashtable

```
solution for future readers: I needed to use the OBJ_FLAG_REF flag to the hashtab so that it wouldn't try to free pointers to objects.
 ```

    t_atom *rav = NULL;
    long rac = 0;
    object_method_typed(max_jit_obex_jitob_get(x),s,ac,av,&rv);
    if (rv.a_type == A_NOTHING) return;
    if (rv.a_type == A_OBJ) {

## Object creation / freeing

### ext_obex.h

```c
/**
  Allocates the memory for an instance of an object class and initialize its object header <em>internal to Max</em>. 
  It is used similarly to the traditional function newinstance(), but its use is required with obex-class objects. 
  The object_new_typed() function differs from object_new() by its use of an atom list for object argumentsâ€”in this way, 
  it more resembles the effect of typing something into an object box from the Max interface.

  @ingroup obj

  @param  name_space  The desired object's name space. Typically, either the 
            constant #CLASS_BOX, for obex classes which can 
            instantiate inside of a Max patcher (e.g. boxes, UI objects, 
            etc.), or the constant #CLASS_NOBOX, for classes 
            which will only be used internally. Developers can define 
            their own name spaces as well, but this functionality is 
            currently undocumented.
  @param  classname The name of the class of the object to be created
  @param  ac      Count of arguments in <tt>av</tt>
  @param  av      Array of t_atoms; arguments to the class's instance creation function.

  @return       This function returns a new instance of the object class if successful, or NULL if unsuccessful.
*/
void *object_new_typed(t_symbol *name_space, t_symbol *classname, long ac, t_atom *av);


/**
  Call the free function and release the memory for an instance of an internal object class previously instantiated using object_new(), object_new_typed() or other new-style object constructor functions (e.g. hashtab_new()). 
  It is, at the time of this writing, a wrapper for the traditional function freeobject(), but its use is suggested with obex-class objects.

  @ingroup obj
  @param  x   The pointer to the object to be freed.

          or one of the other error codes defined in #e_max_errorcodes if unsuccessful.
*/

```



## Checking whether an object is an instance of a class


### ext_obex.h

```c
/**
  Determines if a particular object is an instance of a given class.

  @ingroup obj

  @param  x   The object to test
  @param  name  The name of the class to test this object against
  @return     This function returns 1 if the object is an instance of the named class. Otherwise, 0 is returned.
  @remark     For instance, to determine whether an unknown object pointer is a pointer to a print object, one would call:

  @code
  long isprint = object_classname_compare(x, gensym("print"));
  @endcode
*/
long object_classname_compare(void *x, t_symbol *name);
```



## Dynamic Outlets?

see: https://cycling74.com/forums/dynamic-inlets-outlets

```c
// start the transaction with the box
t_object *b = NULL;
object_obex_lookup(x, _sym_pound_B, (t_object **)&b);
object_method(b, gensym("dynlet_begin"));

// update outlets with one or both of these calls
//outlet_delete(outlet_nth((t_object*)x, i));
//outlet_append((t_object*)x, NULL, gensym("signal"));

// end the transaction with the box
object_method(b, gensym("dynlet_end"));
```



## Outlets

- outlet creation order is important in `outlet_new(x, NULL)`?

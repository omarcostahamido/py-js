I was motivated to start this project because I found myself recurrently wanting to use some python libraries or functions in Max.

Looking around for a python max external I found the following:

- Thomas Grill's [py/pyext â€“ Python scripting objects for Pure Data and Max](https://grrrr.org/research/software/py/) is the most mature Max/Python implementation and when I was starting this project, it seemed very promising but then I read that the 'available Max port is not actively maintained.' I also noted that it was written in C++ and that it needed an additional [c++ flext](http://grrrr.org/ext/flext) layer to compile. I was further dissuaded from diving in as it supported, at the time, only python 2 which seemed difficult to swallow considering Python2 is basically not developed anymore. Ironically, this project has become more active recently, and I finally was persuaded to go back and try to compile it and finally got it running. I found it to be extremely technically impressive work, but it had probably suffered from the burden of having to maintain several moving dependencies (puredata, max, python, flext, c++). The complexity probably put off some possible contributors which would have made the maintenance of the project easier for Thomas. In any case, it's an awesome project and it would be great if this project could somehow help py/ext in some way or the other.

- [max-py](https://github.com/njazz/max-py) -- Embedding Python 2 / 3 in MaxMSP with `pybind11`. This looks like a reasonable effort, but only 9 commits and no further commits for 2 years as of this writing.

- [nt.python_for_max](https://github.com/2bbb/nt.python_for_max) -- Basic implementation of python in max using a fork of Graham Wakefield's old c++ interface. Hasn't really been touched in 3 years.

- [net.loadbang.jython](https://github.com/cassiel/net.loadbang.jython) -- A
  jython implementation for Max which uses the MXJ java interface. It's looks
  like a solid effort using Jython 2.7 but the last commit was in 2015.

Around the time of the beginning of my first covid-19 lockdown, I stumbled upon Iain Duncan's [Scheme for Max](https://github.com/iainctduncan/scheme-for-max) project, and I was quite inspired by his efforts and approach to embed a scheme implementation into a Max external.

So it was decided, during a period with less distractions than usual, to try to make a minimal python3 external, learn the max sdk, the python c-api, and also how to write more than a few lines of c that didn't crash.

It's been an education and I have come to understand precisely a quote I remember somewhere about the c language: that it's "like a scalpel". I now understand this to mean that in skilled hands it can do wonders, otherwise you almost always end up killing the patient.

Thanks to Luigi Castelli for his help with Max/MSP questions, to Stefan Behnel for his help with Cython questions, and to Iain Duncan for providing the initial inspiration and for saving me time with some great implementation ideas.

Thanks to Greg Neagle for zeroing in on the relocatability problem and sharing his elegant solution for Python frameworks via his [relocatable-python](https://github.com/gregneagle/relocatable-python) project on Github.

## Overview

`py/js` started out as an attempt (during a covid-19 lockdown) to develop a basic python3 external for maxmsp. It then evolved into a more ambitious framework for using python3 in max.


There are two implementation variations:

1. A `py` external which provides a more featureful two-way interface between max and python in a way that feels natural to both languages.

2. A `pyjs` max external/jsextension providing a `PyJS` class and a minimal subset of `py's` features which work well with the max `js` object and javascript code (like returning json directly from evaluations of python expressions).

Both externals have access to builtin python modules and the whole universe of 3rd party modules, and further have the option of importing a builtin `api` module which uses [cython](https://cython.org) to wrap the portions of the max c-api. This allows regular python code to directly access the max-c-api and script Max objects.


In addition there are essentially 3 deployment variations:

1. Linking the externals to your system python (homebrew, built from source, etc.) This has the benefit of re-using your existing python modules and is the default option.

2. Embedding python interpreter in a Max package: in this variation, a dedicated python distribution (zipped or otherwise) is placed in the `support` folder of the `py/js` package (or any other package) and is linked to the `py` external or `pyjs` extension (or both). This can possibly make it usable in standalones (untested).

3. The external itself as a container for the python interpreter: a custom python distribution (zipped or otherwise) is stored inside the external/jsextension object, which can makes it very portable and usable in standalones.


Deployment Scenario  | `py` | `pyjs`
:------------------- | :--: | :--------:
Link to sys python   | x    | x 
Embed in package     | x    | untested
Embed in external    | x    | untested



### Key Features


The more mature `py` external has the following c-level methods:

category | method   | param(s)      | in/out | can change ns 
:------- | :--------| :------------ | :----: | :------------: 
core     | import   | module        | in     | yes
core     | eval     | expression    | out    | no
core     | exec     | statement     | in     | yes
core     | execfile | file          | in     | yes
extra    | assign   | var, data     | in     | yes
extra    | call     | var(s), data  | out    | no
extra    | code     | expr or stmt  | out?   | yes
extra    | anything | expr or stmt  | out?   | yes
extra    | pipe     | var, funcs    | out    | no
editor   | read     | file          | n/a    | no
editor   | load     | file          | n/a    | no
interobj | scan     |               | n/a    | no
interobj | send     | name, msg, .. | n/a    | no
meta     | count    |               | n/a    | no


The more recently developed `pyjs` external implements the following c-level methods:

category | method       | param(s)      | in/out | can change ns 
:------- | :----------- | :------------ | :----: | :------------:
core     | import       | module        | in     | yes
core     | eval         | expression    | out    | no
core     | exec         | statement     | in     | yes
core     | execfile     | file          | in     | yes
extra    | code         | expr or stmt  | out?   | yes
in-code  | eval_to_json | expression    | out    | no


In both cases, the `code` method allows for import/exec/eval of python code, which can be said to make those 'fit-for-purpose' methods redundant. However, I have retained them since they are stricter in what they allow and further provide a helpful prefix in messages which indicates message intent.

#### Core

py/js's *core* features have a one-to-one correspondance to python's very high layer as specified [here](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/veryhigh.html). In the following when we refer to 'object', we refer to instances of either the `py` or `pyjs` externals. A note of differences between the variations will be provided when appropriate.

- **Per-object namespaces**. Each object has a unique name (which is provided automatically or can be set by the user), and responds to an `import <module>` message which loads the specified python module in its namespace (essentially a `globals` dictionary). Notably, namespaces can be different for each instance.

- **Eval Messages**. Responds to an `eval <expression>` message in the left inlet which is evaluated in the context of the namespace. `py` objects output results to the left outlet, send a bang from the right outlet upon success or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure. `pyjs` objects just return an `atomarray` of the results.

- **Exec Messages**. Responds to an `exec <statement>` message and an `execfile <filepath>` message which executes the statement or the file's code in the object's namespace. For `py` objects, this produces no output from the left outlet, sends a bang from the right outlet upon success or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure. For `pyjs` objects no output is given.


#### Extra

The *extra* category of methods  makes the `py` or `pyjs` object play nice with the max/msp ecosystem:

Implemented for `py` objects at present:

- **Assign Messages**. Responds to an `assign <varname> [x1, x2, ..., xN]` which is equivalent to `<varname> = [x1, x2, ..., xN]` in the python namespace. This is a way of creating variables in the objects python namespace using max message syntax. This produces no output from the left outlet, a bang from the right outlet upon success, or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure. (Only `py` objects for now)

- **Call Messages**. Responds to a `call <func> arg1 arg2 ... argN` kind of message where `func` is a python callable in the py object's namespace. This corresponds to the python `callable(*args)` syntax. This makes it easier to call python functions in a max-friendly way. If the callable does not variable arguments, it will alternatively try to apply the arguments as a list i.e. `call func(args)`. Future work will try make `call` correspond to a python generic function call: `<callable> [arg1 arg2 ... arg_n] [key1=val1 key2=val2 ... keyN=valN]`. This outputs results to the left outlet, a bang from the right outlet upon success, or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure.

- **Pipe message**. Like a `call` in reverse, responds to a `pipe <arg> <f1> <f2> ... <fN>` message. In this sense, a value is *piped* through a chain of python functions in the objects namespace and returns the output to the left outlet, a bang from the right outlet upon success, or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure.


Implemented for both `py` and `pyjs` objects:

- **Code or Anything Messages**. Responds to a `code <expression || statement>` or (anything) `<expression || statement>` message. Arbitrary python code (expression or statement) can be used here, because the whole message body is converted to a string, the complexity of the code is only limited by max's parsing and excaping rules. (EXPERIMENTAL and evolving).

Implemented for `pyjs` objects only:

- **Evaluate to JSON**. Can be used in javascript code only to automatically serialize the results of a python expression as a json string as follows: `evaluate_to_json <expression> -> JSON`.


#### Interobject Communication

Implemented for `py` objects only:

- **Scan Message**. Responds to a `scan` message with arguments. This scans the parent patcher of the object and stores scripting names in the global registry.

- **Send Message**. Responds to a `send <object-name> <msg> <msg-body>` message. Used to send *typed* messages to any named object. Evokes a `scan` for the patcher's objects if a `registry` of names is empty.


#### Code Editor

Implemented for `pyjs` objects only:

- **Line REPL**. The `py`has two bpatcher line `repls`, one of which embeds a `py` object and another which has an outlet to connect to one. The repls include a convenient menu with all the `py` object's methods and also feature coll-based history via arrow-up/arrow-down recall of all entries in a session. Of course, a coll can made to save all commands if required.

- **Code Editor**. Double-clicking the `py` object opens a code-editor. This is populated by a `read` message which reads a file into the editor and saves the filepath to an attribute. A `load` message also `reads` the file followed by `execfile`. Saving the text in the editor uses the attribute filepath and execs the saved text to the object's namespace.


#### Scripting

Implemented for both `py` and `pyjs` objects:

- **Exposing Max API to Python** A significant part of the max api in `c74support/max-includes` has been converted to a cython `.pxd` file called `api_max.pxd`. This makes it available for a cython implementation file, `api.pyx` which is converted to c-code during builds and embedded in the external. This enables a custom python builtin module called `api` which can be imported by python scripts in `py` objects or via `import` messages to the object. This allows the subset of the max-api which has been wrapped in cython code to be called by python scripts or via messages in a patcher.


## Caveats

- The `py` and `pyjs` objects are currently marked as experimental pre-alpha and still need further unit/functional/integration testing and field testing of course. Do not use it expecting they are battle-tested!

- As of this writing, the `api` module, indeed most likely all 3rd party python c-extensions, do not unload properly between patches and require a restart of Max to work after you close the first patch which uses them. Unfortunately, this is a [bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue34309)in python which is being worked on and may be [fixed](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/cython-users/SnVpCE7Sq8M/hdT8S2iFBgAJ) in future versions.

    - `Numpy`, the popular python numerical analysis package falls in the above category, but actually **crashes** Max if imported in a new patch after first use in a prior patch. To address this special case, the module is provided as an object in the `api` module (and this prevents a crash if used again). As above, just restart Max and use it in one patch normally. After closing the first patch, restart Max to use it again in a new patch. (New patch is taken to mean new document.)

- `core` features are supposed to be the most stable, and *should* not crash under most circumstances, `extra` features are less stable since they are more experimental, etc.. 

- The `api` module is the most experimental and evolving part of this project, and is completely optional. If you don't want to use it, don't import it.


## Building

Only tested on OS X at present. Should be relatively easy to port to windows. I'm personally not in a position to do so since I don't have another Max license left for Windows and I'm on Macs and Linux.

The following is required:

### Xcode

Not sure if full xcode is required, perhaps only the command line tools are sufficient

```
$ xcode-select --install
```

otherwise download xcode from the app store.


### py external source and maxsdk

The py external is developed as a max package with a `source` folder which contains the max-sdk as a subfolder, which is conveniently available as a git submodule.

First git clone the `py` repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/shakfu/py.git
```

Then cd into the newly cloned source directory and run the following to get the max-sdk

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update 

```

### python3

Python is used to develop `py`, and should be installed on a mac. However, `py` is tested again [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) python on a MacOS Mojave 10.14.6.

The latest python3 can be easily installed can be installed as follows if you already have brew other click on the link above and install it before this step.

```
$ brew install python
```

see: https://installpython3.com/mac for further info if you are interested.


### cython (optional)

[Cython](https://cython.org) is used for wrapping the max api. One could de-couple the cython generated c code from the external and it would work fine since the latter is developed directly using the python c-api, but you would lose the nice feature of calling the max api from python scripts running inside `py` objects.

Install cython as follows:

```
pip install cython
```


### Build it

In the root of the package:

```
make -C source/py build
```
or

```
./build.sh
```
or in the `py/sources/py` directory

```
make build
```

This builds the default 'linked-to-system|homebrew python' version of `py`. Read further for alternative ways to build and install `py`.


### Alternative Builds


#### Embed Python in the Package

In the root,

```
make source/py -C homebrew-pkg
```

or in root/source/py

```
make homebrew-pkg
```

The same pattern applies to the rest of the options. We will assume that you have cd'ed into `root/source/py` so you can omit `-C source/py` which only applies if you call from the root directory.

If you want to copy and zip your system homebrew python and make it a dedicated python interpreter for the `py` object. Note, this does not install any modules. It's up to you to populate what you require.

If you want to build and install cpython from source (will be done automatically):

```
make python-org-pkg
```

#### Embed Python in the External itself

This places a whole minimized python distribution in the external `py.mxo` itself.

To use your system homebrew python to do this:

```
make homebrew-ext
```

If you want to download and build python from source (will be done automatically)

```
make python-org-ext
```


### Sidenote about building on a Mac

If you are developing the package in `$HOME/Documents/Max 8/Packages/py` and you have your icloud drive on for Documents, you will find that `make` or `xcodebuild` will reliably fail with 1 error during development, a codesigning error that is due to icloud sync creating detritus in the dev folder. This can mostly ignored (unless your only focus is codesigning the external).

The solution is to move the external project folder to a non iCloud drive folder (such as $HOME/Downloads for example) and then run "xattr -cr ." in the the project directory to remove the detritus (ironically which Apple's system is itself creating) and then it should succeed (provided you have your Info.plist and bundle id correctly specified). 

I've tried this several times and  and it works (for "sign to run locally" case and for the "Development" case).


### Style it

The coding style for this project can applied automatically during the build process with `clang-format`. On OS X, you can easily install using brew:

```
$ brew install clang-format
```

The style used in this project is specified in the `.clang-format` file.


## BUGS

- [ ] Workflow using the code-editor is not intuitive. Test all scenarios

- [ ] CRITICAL: attempting to reload numpy after the patcher is closed crashes Max (except when you load it through `api` module!)

- [ ] `PyLong_Check` can't pick up `numpy` numbers 

- [ ] `api` object won't reload if a patch is closed (i.e. PyFinalize) and new one opened. Requires a restart of Max. (Python bug which is being worked on).


## TODO


### Core

- [ ] enhance `call` to allow kwargs [call fn x1 x2 y1=z1 y2=z2]


### Extension

- [ ] add more api wrappers.


### Attributes & Infrastructure

- [ ] add set/get for attributes as appropriate to trigger actions or methods calls
      after changes (NO REASON for using this found so far)

## CHANGELOG


### v0.1


#### Features

##### Core

- [x] pyjs in-function calls to code did not work well as strings (conversion to array fixed it)

- [x] no-return ops in`pyjs` such as `exec` and `import` somehow make javascript assume an error has occured.


- [x] Convert `py` into a `jsextension` class

- [x] create new `py_anything` with heuristics to decide whether to delegate to `py_call` or `py_code`.

- [x] add `autoload` attribute to trigger autoload (`load` msg) of code editor code

- [x] for `pythonpath` add file location feature (try pkg/examples/scripts then absolute paths)

- [x] branch `embed-pkg`, embeds a local python install with a zipped stdlib in `support` already successfully tested embedding the python distro in the external itself.

- [x] made it possible to get the py object's name from any module in its namespace!

- [x] enhance `py_exec` method to create a single string from argv so it can import easily

- [x] enhance `py_anything` method to eval if identifier is not a callable yet exists in ns

- [x] Refactor 'py_eval' to make it more consistent with the others

- [x] Implementation of a few high level python api functions in max (eval, exec) to allow the evaluation of python code in a python `globals` namespace associated with the py object.

- [x] Each py object has its own python 'globals' namespace and responds to the following
      msgs
    - [x] `import <module>`: adds module to the namespace
    - [x] `eval <expression>`: evaluate expression within the context of the namespace (cannot modify ns)
    - [x] `exec <statement>`: executes statement into the namespace (can modify ns)
    - [x] `execfile <file.py>`: executes python file into the namespace (can modify ns)
    - [x] `run <file.py>`: executes python file into the namespace (can modify ns)

- [x] Add right inlet bang after eval op ends

- [x] add third (middle) outlet which bangs on an error

##### Extra


- [x] check whether setting a normal attr name, can also set scripting name

- [x] Implement 'send' msg, which sends typed messages to (script) named objects (see: https://cycling74.com/forums/error-handling-with-object_method_typed)

- [x] Add `call (anything)` method to call python callables in a namespace


##### Code Editor (Usability)

- [x] Edit default with text editor

- [x] Add text edit object
    - [x] enable code to be run from editor


##### Line REPL (Usability)

- [x] Add line repl
    - [x] Add up-arrow last line recall (great for 'random.random()')


##### Extensibility

- [x] Create type conversion method in `api.pyx` which could serve python code and also c-code calling python code

- [x] Implement section on two-way globals setting and reading (from python and c) in https://pythonextensionpatterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_globals.html (deferred for now)

- [x] Add bpatcher line repl

- [x] add python scripts to 'examples/scripts'

- [x] Add cythonized access to max c-api..?

- [x] Extensible by embedded cython based python extensions which can call a library of wrapped max_api functions in python code. There is a proof of concept of the python code in the namsepace calling the max api `post` function successfully.

- [x] Exposing of good portion of the max api to cython scripting


##### Architectural

- [x] Global object/dict/ref mgmt (so two externals can exist without Py_Finalize() causing a crash


##### Documentation

- [x] Add .maxref.xml to docs


##### Code Quality

- [x] refactor error handling code (if possible)

- [x] Refactor eval code from py_eval into a function to allow for exec and execfile or PyRun_File scenarios

- [x] Refactor into functions


##### Testing

- [x] pytest testing harness

- [x] make test between test_translate and test_py2 which includes references to a the struct which is missing in the former


#### Bug Fixes

- [x] fixed 'send' which did not have enough error checking and was crashing frequently

- [x] fixed STRANGE bug, single quotes in `py_log` cased a crash in `py_scan_callback`, it's based on post but post alone with the same does not cause a crash. Should simplify logging!

- [x] globex remains after all objects are freed. solution: `PyXDECREF x->p_globals` on `py_free`

- [x] space in `eval` without quotes will cause a crash!

- [x] space in path causes "sprintf" type debugging in execfile to crash max!

- [x] codesigning errors are due to Package being developed in Documents/... which causes issues. If it's a non icloud exposed folder it works ok.

- [x] make exec work! (needs globals in both slots: `PyRun_String(py_argv, Py_single_input, x->p_globals, x->p_globals)`

- [x] `import` statement in eval causes a segmentation fault. see: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html exception handling example -> needed to changed Py_DECREF to Py_XDECREF in error handling code

- [x] do not give attr has same name as method (the import saga) as this will crash. fix by making them different.


### leo (optional)

[leo-editor](https://leoeditor.com) is used to factilitate documentation and restructuring.

It is entirely optional, however, if one is interested it could be helpful to understand the project code in outline form:

To install it you can create a python `virtual environment` in the project root (which is ignored by `.gitignore` if named as `leoenv`:

```
$ virtualenv leoenv
$ source leoenv/bin/activate
$ pip install leo
```

After installation, you can open the `project.leo` file as follows:

```
$ leo project.leo &
```


## Prior Art and Thanks

Every now and then when I am developing a patch in Max, I yearn for some simple python function or the other, like the `any` and `all` builtins for example, and I then spend more time than I want researching a Max workaround. 

Thinking that there must be a max external out there, I looked around and found the following:

- Thomas Grill's [py/pyext – Python scripting objects for Pure Data and Max](https://grrrr.org/research/software/py/) which looked very promising but then I read that the 'available Max port is not actively maintained.' I also noted that it's written in C++ and needs an additional [c++ flext](http://grrrr.org/ext/flext) layer  to compile. But I was further dissuaded from diving in as it supported only python 2 which seemed difficult to swallow considering it is no longer supported. Ironically, this project has become more active recently, so the above may no longer apply.

- [max-py](https://github.com/njazz/max-py) -- Embedding Python 2 / 3 in MaxMSP with pybind11. This looks like a reasonable effort, but only 9 commits and no further commits for 16 months as of this writing. Again c++ and using pybind11 which I'm not familiar with.

Around the time of the beginning of the covid-19 lockdown, I stumbled upon Iain Duncan's [Scheme for Max](https://github.com/iainctduncan/scheme-for-max) project, and I was quite inspired by his efforts to embed a scheme implementation into a Max external.

So I decided, during a period with less distractions than usual, to try to make a minimal python3 external, learn the max sdk, the python c-api, and how to write more than a few lines of c that won't crash.

It's been an education and I have come to understand precisely a quote I remember somewhere about the c language: that it's "like a scalpel". I painfully now understand this to mean that in skilled hands it can do wonders, otherwise you almost always end up killing the patient.

Thanks to Luigi Castelli for his help on Max/Msp questions and to Stefan Behnel for his help with Cython questions.
